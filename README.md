It looks like this:

To be improved
--------------

Things that may be done better:

* On Aplite platforms, the watchface has to query the phone to get time zone
information. I'm not sure whether it's reliable.

* Display more information on the watchface but don't make it look too complicated.

* Add bezel and markers to make it look clearer.
